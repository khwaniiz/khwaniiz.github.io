        <div id="first"><p><b>KeeNok</b> is a pop up focused on authentic dishes from Thailand as well as a few of our favorites from around the Asian continent. 
                The idea sprang from our desperate search to find dishes from Thailand that just aren’t currently available in Chicago. 
                We determined the only way we could enjoy these foods was to make them ourselves and so our journey began. 
                Through trial, error and a whole lot of Thai cooking Youtube videos, we learned how to make some really tasty stuff. 
                We started inviting friends over to try our latest creations and that eventually lead to the birth of KeeNok.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="second"><p>A little background on us: Bote grew up in Bangkok, eating some of the best food the country has to offer. 
                She is the official taste tester of KeeNok and makes sure everything is aroy (delicious). 
                She also has a degree in computer engineering and spent countless hours building our website. 
                John is from Savannah Georgia and is beyond obsessed with food from every part of the world, especially Southeast Asia. 
                When he’s not in the kitchen he’s a practicing Landscape Architect.</p> 
        </div>
        
        <div id="third"><p>KeeNok is hosted out of our small 2 bedroom apartment in Logan Square and seating is limited, 
                which leads to a very communal dining experience. Our goal is to bring people together from 
                all walks of life around unique, delicious food prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients, many of which we grow in our garden. 
                Please feel free to reach out with any questions. We are so excited to be able to share this food we love with friends both old and new.</p>
