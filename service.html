      <h2>SWEDISH MASSAGE</h2>
      <h3>60 MINUTES: $65 | 90 MINUTES: $90</h3> 
      <img src="C:\Users\chalermkhwan\Documents\Pom\image\swedish.jpg" alt="swedish-massage">
      <p>Swedish Massage is a very relaxing and therapeutic style of bodywork. 
        It combines oils or lotion with an array of strokes such as rolling, kneading, 
        and percussion to help the body improve its circulation. The benefits of this 
        type of bodywork are wide-ranging and include relief from aches and pains, 
        decreased stress levels in the body, enhanced mental clarity, improved appearance, and greater flexibility.</p>

      <h2>DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE</h2>
      <h3>60 MINUTES: $65 | 90 MINUTES: $90</h3> 
      <img src="C:\Users\chalermkhwan\Documents\Pom\image\deepTissue.jpg" alt="DeepTissueMassage">
      <p>Deep Tissue Massage is a form of bodywork that aims to relieve tension in the deeper layers of tissue in the body. 
        Deep Tissue Massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment, 
        repetitive motions, and past lingering injuries. Due to the nature of the deep tissue work, open communication 
        during the session is crucial to make sure you don't get too uncomfortable. Keep in mind that soreness is 
        pretty common after the treatment, and that plenty of water should be ingested to aid with the flushing and 
        removal of toxins that will have been released from the deep tissue during the session.</p>

        <h2>SPORTS MASSAGE</h2>
        <h3>60 MINUTES: $65 | 90 MINUTES: $90</h3> 
        <img src="C:\Users\chalermkhwan\Documents\Pom\image\sports.jpg" alt="SportsMassage">
        <p>Sports Massage is a type of massage designed for highly active people who engage in athletics. 
          Engaging in sports is harsh on the body and can often lead to injuries in both the short and long term. 
          Sports Massage enhances performance and prolongs a sports career by helping to prevent injury, 
          reduce pains and swelling in the body, relax the mind, increase flexibility, and dramatically improve recovery rates. 
          Sports Massage is also highly effective in aiding the rapid recovery of an athlete from an injury by 
          encouraging greater kinesthetic awareness and in turn promoting the body's natural immune function.</p>

      <div class="container" id="trigger">
        <h2>TRIGGER POINT THERAPY</h2>
        <h3>60 MINUTES: $65 | 90 MINUTES: $90</h3> 
        <img src="C:\Users\chalermkhwan\Documents\Pom\image\trigger.jpg" alt="TriggerPointTherapy">
        <p>Trigger Point Therapy is a style of bodywork that focuses on stimulating and releasing "trigger points" in your body. 
          Trigger points are tender areas of tension similar to acupressure points, except they occur in the belly of 
          the muscle rather than along the energy pathways of the body. These "knots" are built up throughout a person's life due to physical, 
          mental, and/or emotional stress. During a session, focused pressure is applied through a variety of techniques order to release 
          your trigger points. This process can be quite painful at times, yet the effects are lasting and profoundly transformative.</p>
